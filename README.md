# Dojima Launch

The Dojima Network is releasing the genesis information for the Dojima Testnet.

Please be aware that there is no guarantee a network will start from this recommendation - nodes and validators may never come online, the community may disregard the recommendation and choose different genesis files, and/or they may modify the software in arbitrary ways. Such outcomes and many more are outside the Dojima Networks's control and completely in the hands of the community.

Users wishing to interact with the network should carefully review how to protect themselves and the security advisories in the recent communication provided in the docs on preparing for main net launch.

Please note that this is highly experimental software. In these early days, we can expect to have issues, updates, and bugs. The existing tools require advanced technical skills and involve risks which are outside of the control of the Dojima Network and/or the Dojima team. Any use of this open source software is done at your own risk and on a “AS IS” basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, and any and all liability of the Dojima Network and/or the Dojima team for damages arising in connection to the software is excluded. Please exercise extreme caution!

Further, please note that it remains in the community's sole discretion to adopt or not to adopt the recommended genesis info and associated software.
